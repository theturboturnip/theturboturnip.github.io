## Education
### PhD in Computer Science - [University of Cambridge](https://cam.ac.uk)

October 2022 - Present

Ongoing, planning to submit in March 2026

* **Secure FPGA Design**
  
  Designed a high-throughput cryptography accelerator for checking memory accesses at the edges of the interconnect.
  Verified the design using a custom C++ UVM testbench with Verilator.
  Integrated with a pre-existing soft-CPU interconnect design on a Stratix-10 FPGA.
      

* **Low-Level Operating System Integration**
  
  Wrote drivers and other software for interacting with the cryptography accelerator in multiple operating systems, including FreeBSD, using C, C++, Rust, and Python.
      

* **Writing and Communication**
  
  Wrote an article for [ACM Queue](https://spawn-queue.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3606014) on high-performance memory safety in CXL, which was subsequently published in Communications of the ACM - the official magazine of the world's largest scientific computing society.
  [The article is available online.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3617580)
      


### M.Phil in Advanced Computer Science - [University of Cambridge](https://cam.ac.uk)

October 2021 - June 2022

Distinction - [Thesis won 1st place in the RISE 2022 Student Competition](https://x.com/UK_RISE/status/1598685532434964480)

* **Large-Scale Data Processing and Systems Research**
  
  Evaluated and presented research papers on many areas in large-scale data processing and cloud computing, focusing on GPU-based data processing.
  Profiled and replicated results from an open-source CPU/GPU stream processing research project.
      

* **RISC-V Vector Emulation & Security**
  
  Built a RISC-V CPU emulator with support for the "V" vector extension, the CHERI memory safety extension, and a combination of the two.
  Added support for combined instructions to Clang/LLVM, tested using C++ inline assembly.

### B.Eng in Computer Systems Engineering - [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk)

October 2018 - July 2021

First Class - Best overall graduating student in subject

* **High Performance CPU and GPU Programming**
  
  Achieved best-in-class (64x) speedup on a C fluid simulation with bit-for-bit accuracy using multithreading and vectorized assembly code.
  Moved the fluid simulation to the GPU using CUDA, with Vulkan graphics for real-time visualization, for my final-year project.
  [The project is available online.](https://theturboturnip.com/academia/2021-05-01-fluid-dynamics-opt-viz)
      

* **High Performance FPGA Design**
  
  Built a high-speed video processing filter on an FPGA using SystemVerilog with various parameters controlled in real-time from the onboard hard Arm CPU.
      

* **Machine Learning**
  
  Learned basics of classic machine learning and neural networks/deep learning.
      


## Work
### Memory & Systems Architecture Research Intern - [Arm Ltd](https://arm.com)
