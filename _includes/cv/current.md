### [GPU Fluid Simulation/Visualization](https://theturboturnip.github.io/academia/2021-05-01-fluid-dynamics-opt-viz)

2020 - 2021

Created a real-time GPU fluid simulation (CUDA) and parallel visualization (C++/Vulkan).
* Ported a fluid simulation from C to CUDA
* Implemented a GPU visualization in Vulkan
* Implemented various synchronization between CPUs and GPU
* Used memory sharing between CUDA and Vulkan to reduce copying


### FPGA Image Processing

2021 - 2021

Built high-performance image filter in SystemVerilog.
* Designed highly performant image filtering kernels (3x3 convolution, 1x1 brightness/contrast)
* Implemented CPU-based real-time brightness adjustment using APB to communicate with the FPGA
* Developed a Python library for converting VGA signals to images for automatic testing
