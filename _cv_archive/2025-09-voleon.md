I created this version for a hedge fund named [The Voleon Group](https://voleon.com/), who cold-emailed me to ask if I was interested in a [Research Staff position](https://web.archive.org/web/20250930055417/https://jobs.lever.co/voleon/efb28427-6283-47fa-99b0-c2f634d09e89) after my PhD.
I was skeptical - the position appeared to be intended for a mathematical/statistics background, and that's not really my field, but given they were asking after me I figured I'd throw something together.
You can see my emphasis on ML, large scale data, and Python; but I can't really escape my hardware/graphics origins (not that I'd want to!) and in the end the recruiter and I agreed that I would be more suited to something like hardware/software co-design (also difficult to recruit for, apparently).
