My first article, "How Flexible is CXL's Memory Protection?", was just published in ACM Queue (it's even on the front cover!)
It discusses PCIe and CXL, their memory security model (and how it leaves something to be desired), and various flavors of _capability_ which may be able to help.
[The article is available online here](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3606014), and I plan to publish a copy here in the coming weeks to demo [my pie-in-the-sky alternative typesetting language](https://github.com/theturboturnip/turnip_text).
