This is a condensed version of my master's thesis (from 15,000 to 5,000 words), which [won the RISE 2022 Student competition!](https://twitter.com/UK_RISE/status/1598685532434964480)
I also submitted a 5-minute presentation, which is available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J82OFvF3yGY) and [the project summary page](/academia/2022-06-06-capability-protection-scalable-vectors).

The RISE submission form did not allow images, so it's a bit sparse.
I plan to release the full chapters as blogposts in the future, images and tables included, which will serve as a testing ground for [my pie-in-the-sky alternative typesetting language](https://github.com/theturboturnip/turnip_text).
